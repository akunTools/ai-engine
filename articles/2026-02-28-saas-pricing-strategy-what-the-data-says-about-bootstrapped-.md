# Data-Driven SaaS Pricing Strategy for Bootstrapped Products Under $100/month

When it comes to pricing your suçbootstrapped SaaS product, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. However, by examining real-world benchmarks and data, you can make informed decisions that drive revenue growth and customer acquisition. In this article, we'll delve into the world of SaaS pricing strategy, focusing on bootstrapped products under $100/month.

## The State of SaaS Pricing

According to recent data, the median ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for bootstrapped B2B SaaS products is between $40-80 per month. This range is not surprising, given the competitive nature of the market. To stand out, you need to offer value that justifies the price point.

## Pricing Tiers and Their Impact

Research suggests that most successful SaaS products use pricing tiers, offering different levels of features and support. This approach allows you to cater to a wide range of customers, from individual users to large enterprises. By structuring your pricing tiers, you can:

* Increase average revenue per user (ARPU)
* Improve customer satisfaction and retention
* Enhance your brand's perceived value

## Pricing Benchmarks for Bootstrapped SaaS

When it comes to pricing benchmarks, here are some key takeaways:

* Most common price points: $19, $29, $49, $99 per month
* Annual discount: 15-20% is standard (2 months free = 17%)
* Churn rate: 2-5% per month is common for B2B SaaS (SMB)

## The Numbers Behind This

Let's consider an example. Suppose you're offering a SaaS product with a monthly price of $49. With an annual discount of 17%, your customers would pay $41.33 per month. If you have 100 customers, your MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) would be $4,133. This is a significant revenue stream, especially considering the low churn rate.

## What To Do Right Now

To implement a data-driven SaaS pricing strategy, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze your customer base**: Understand your customers' needs, pain points, and willingness to pay.
2. **Research your competition**: Identify pricing tiers, features, and support offered by similar products.
3. **Set clear goals**: Determine your revenue targets, growth rate, and customer acquisition costs.
4. **Test and iterate**: Experiment with different pricing tiers, features, and support levels to find the sweet spot.

## Tool Recommendation

To help you analyze your customer base and competition, consider using tools like:

* Ahrefs for keyword research and competitor analysis
* SEMrush for competitor analysis and market research
* Google Analytics for customer behavior and conversion tracking

By following a data-driven approach to SaaS pricing strategy, you can create a pricing model that drives revenue growth, customer acquisition, and retention. Remember to regularly review and adjust your pricing tiers to ensure they remain competitive and aligned with your business goals.
