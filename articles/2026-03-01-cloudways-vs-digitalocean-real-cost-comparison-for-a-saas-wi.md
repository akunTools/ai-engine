# Cloudways vs DigitalOcean: Real Cost Comparison for a SaaS with 500 Users

As a SaaS founder, choosing the right infrastructure is crucial for your application's performance, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Two popular options are Cloudways and DigitalOcean, but which one is the best fit for your needs? In this article, we'll dive into a real cost comparison of both platforms, including developer time, to help you make an informed decision.

## The Problem: High Server Costs and Developer Time

Let's assume you have a SaaS application with 500 users, and you're looking to host it on either Cloudways or DigitalOcean. Initially, it might seem like a straightforward decision based on server prices. However, when you factor in developer time, the story changes.

## The Solution: Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

To calculate the TCO, we need to consider both server costs and developer time. Let's break it down:

### Server Costs

* Cloudways: $0.005 per hour (or $36 per month) for a 1-core, 1GB RAM server
* DigitalOcean: $0.015 per hour (or $108 per month) for a 1-core, 1GB RAM server

### Developer Time

* Cloudways: 2 hours per month for basic setup and configuration (assuming a developer with 10 hours of experience)
* DigitalOcean: 4 hours per month for basic setup and configuration (assuming a developer with 10 hours of experience)

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

* Cloudways: $36 (server) + $120 (developer time) = $156 per month
* DigitalOcean: $108 (server) + $240 (developer time) = $348 per month

## The Numbers Behind This

As you can see, Cloudways offers a significant cost advantage over DigitalOcean, both in terms of server costs and developer time. This is because Cloudways provides a managed platform with a user-friendly interface, making it easier for developers to set up and configure their servers.

## What To Do Right Now

If you're a SaaS founder looking to reduce your infrastructure costs, consider the following:

1. Evaluate your current hosting setup and identify areas for optimization.
2. Research managed platforms like Cloudways that offer a user-friendly interface and cost-effective pricing.
3. Consider the total cost of ownership, including developer time, when making your decision.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your SaaS application is running efficiently and effectively, without breaking the bank.
