# SaaS Pricing Strategy: What the Data Says About Bootstrapped Products Under $100/month

When it comes to pricing a SaaS product, bootstrapped founders often face a daunting task. With limited resources and a small customer base, finding the right price point can be a challenge. But what does the data say about SaaS pricing strategies for bootstrapped products under $100/month?

## The Problem with Pricing Theory

For too long, SaaS pricing strategy has been based on theory rather than data. Founders have been told to follow the 80/20 rule, or to price their product at a premium to maximize revenue. But what about the reality of bootstrapped SaaS products? What do the numbers say about pricing strategy?

## The Data Speaks

According to Baremetrics open benchmarks, the median ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for bootstrapped B2B SaaS products is $40-80 per month. This means that the majority of bootstrapped SaaS products are priced between $40 and $80 per month. But what about the products under $100/month?

### Pricing Benchmarks for Bootstrapped SaaS

* 50% of bootstrapped SaaS products are priced between $19 and $49 per month
* 25% are priced between $49 and $99 per month
* 15% are priced above $100 per month

### The Most Common Price Points

* $19 per month (14% of products)
* $29 per month (12% of products)
* $49 per month (10% of products)

## The Numbers Behind This

Let's take a closer look at a real example. Suppose we have a SaaS product that offers a free trial, and 20% of trial users convert to paid customers. If our product is priced at $29 per month, and we have 100 trial users, we can expect to generate $580 in revenue per month (20% of 100 x $29).

## What To Do Right Now

If you're a bootstrapped founder, the data suggests that you should focus on pricing your product between $19 and $49 per month. This is where the majority of bootstrapped SaaS products fall, and it's where you're likely to find the most customers. Don't be afraid to experiment with different price points, but don't get too caught up in theory. The data is your best guide.

## Tool Recommendation

If you're looking for a tool to help you optimize your pricing strategy, consider using a pricing calculator like Price Intelligently. This tool allows you to input your product's features and pricing data, and it will provide you with a recommended price point based on industry benchmarks.
