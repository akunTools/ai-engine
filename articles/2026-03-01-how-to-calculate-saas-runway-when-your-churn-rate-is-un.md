# The Hidden Pitfall in SaaS Runway Calculations

Have you ever felt like you're flying blind when it comes to your SaaS business's runway? You know, that magical number that tells you how long you can keep going without raising more capital. Well, you're not alone. Many founders make the same mistake when calculating their SaaS runway: ignoring churn.

## The Problem with Ignoring Churn

Churn is a crucial metric in SaaS, and it's not just about losing customers. It's about the cash flow implications of those losses. When you ignore churn, you're essentially assuming that your customer base is static, and that's just not true. In reality, customers are constantly joining and leaving your platform.

## The Consequences of Ignoring Churn

Ignoring churn can lead to a significant underestimation of your runway. Let's say you have 1,000 customers, and your average revenue per user (ARPU) is $50. If you assume a 0% churn rate, your monthly revenue would be $50,000. But if your actual churn rate is 5%, you'll lose 50 customers per month, resulting in a revenue loss of $2,500. That's a 5% reduction in revenue, which can have a significant impact on your runway.

## The Solution: A More Accurate SaaS Runway Calculator

To calculate your SaaS runway with an unpredictable churn rate, you need to use a more advanced formula. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Determine your current customer base and ARPU.
2. Estimate your monthly churn rate (this can be a range, as it's unpredictable).
3. Calculate your monthly revenue based on your ARPU and customer base.
4. Calculate your monthly revenue loss due to churn.
5. Subtract the revenue loss from your monthly revenue to get your net revenue.
6. Divide your net revenue by your monthly expenses to get your runway.

## The Numbers Behind This

Let's say you have 1,000 customers, and your ARPU is $50. Your monthly revenue is $50,000. If your churn rate is 5%, you'll lose 50 customers per month, resulting in a revenue loss of $2,500. Your net revenue would be $47,500. If your monthly expenses are $20,000, your runway would be 2.38 months.

## What To Do Right Now

Don't ignore churn in your SaaS runway calculations. It may seem like a small detail, but it can have a significant impact on your business. Use a more advanced formula to calculate your runway, and make sure to regularly review your churn rate to ensure you're making accurate predictions.

## Tool Recommendation

Consider using a SaaS runway calculator with churn rate, such as the one provided by Baremetrics. This tool will help you calculate your runway based on your customer base, ARPU, and churn rate.
