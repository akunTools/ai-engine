# The Churn Rate Trap: How to Calculate SaaS Runway When Your Churn Rate is Unpredictable

As a bootstrapped SaaS founder, you're constantly juggling multiple balls in the air. One of the most critical ones is calculating your SaaS runway – the amount of time your business can sustain itself before running out of cash. However, when your churn rate is unpredictable, it's easy to fall into the churn rate trap, making a critical mistake that can put your entire business at risk.

## The Churn Rate Trap: Ignoring Churn in Runway Calculation

Many founders make the mistake of ignoring their churn rate when calculating their SaaS runway. They might use a simple formula like ARR / Monthly Burn to estimate their runway, but this approach is flawed. Churn rate is a critical component of your business's financial health, and ignoring it can lead to a grossly inaccurate estimate of your runway.

## The Consequences of Ignoring Churn

When you ignore churn in your runway calculation, you're essentially assuming that your customer base will remain static. However, this is rarely the case. In reality, your churn rate will fluctuate, and if you're not accounting for it, you'll be caught off guard when your runway suddenly shortens.

## The Numbers Behind This

Let's say your ARR is $10,000 per month, and your monthly burn is $5,000. Using the simple formula ARR / Monthly Burn, you might estimate your runway to be 2 months. However, if your churn rate is 10% per month, you can expect to lose 10 customers per month. Assuming an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $100, you'll lose $1,000 per month in revenue. This means your actual runway is only 1.5 months, not 2.

## What To Do Right Now

To avoid the churn rate trap, you need to incorporate your churn rate into your runway calculation. Here's a simple formula to get you started:

Runway = (ARR / (Monthly Burn + (Churn Rate x ARPU)))

This formula takes into account your churn rate and ARPU, giving you a more accurate estimate of your runway.

## The Tool You Need

While there are many SaaS runway calculators available, few of them take into account churn rate. To get a more accurate estimate of your runway, you'll need to use a custom-built calculator or create your own spreadsheet. You can also use online tools like Baremetrics or ProfitWell to get a more accurate estimate of your churn rate.

## The Bottom Line

Calculating your SaaS runway is critical to your business's success. However, ignoring churn rate can lead to a grossly inaccurate estimate of your runway. By incorporating your churn rate into your calculation, you'll get a more accurate estimate of your runway and avoid the churn rate trap.
