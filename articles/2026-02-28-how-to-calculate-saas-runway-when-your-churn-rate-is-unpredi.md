# The Hidden Pitfall in SaaS Runway Calculations

As a fellow founder, you're likely no stranger to the concept of SaaS runway. It's a crucial metric that helps you gauge how long your business can sustain itself before running out of cash. However, there's a common mistake that many founders make when calculating their runway, and it's one that can lead to catastrophic consequences.

## The Problem: Ignoring Churn in Runway Calculations

When calculating your SaaS runway, most founders focus on the following formula:

Runway = Current Cash / Monthly Net Burn Rate

This formula is simple and straightforward, but it's also incomplete. It doesn't take into account one of the most critical factors that can affect your runway: churn.

## The Consequences of Ignoring Churn

Churn, or customer turnover, can have a significant impact on your runway. When customers cancel their subscriptions, you lose not only the revenue from that customer but also the opportunity to upsell or cross-sell them in the future. This can lead to a downward spiral of lost revenue and reduced cash flow.

## The Solution: A More Accurate Runway Calculation

To calculate your SaaS runway accurately, you need to take into account your churn rate. The formula for this is:

Runway = Current Cash / (Monthly Net Burn Rate + (Churn Rate x Average Revenue per User))

This formula takes into account the fact that your churn rate will affect your revenue and cash flow over time. By including churn in your calculation, you can get a more accurate picture of your runway and make more informed decisions about your business.

## A Concrete Example

Let's say your business has the following metrics:

* Current Cash: $100,000
* Monthly Net Burn Rate: $20,000
* Churn Rate: 10%
* Average Revenue per User: $50

Using the formula above, your runway would be:

Runway = $100,000 / ($20,000 + ($0.10 x $50)) = 4.76 months

This is a much more accurate calculation than the original formula, which would have given you a runway of 5 months.

## What to Do Right Now

If you're not already taking into account your churn rate in your runway calculations, it's time to start. This will give you a more accurate picture of your business's financial health and help you make more informed decisions about your growth strategy.
