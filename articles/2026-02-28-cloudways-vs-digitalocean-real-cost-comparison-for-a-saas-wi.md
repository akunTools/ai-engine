# Cloudways vs DigitalOcean: Real Cost Comparison for a SaaS with 500 Users

As a SaaS founder, choosing the right hosting infrastructure is crucial for your business's growth and profitability. Two popular options are Cloudways and DigitalOcean, but which one is more cost-effective for a SaaS with 500 users? In this article, we'll dive into a real cost comparison, including developer time, to help you make an informed decision.

## The Problem with DigitalOcean for SaaS

DigitalOcean is a popular choice for developers due to its affordable pricing and ease of use. However, for a SaaS with 500 users, the costs can add up quickly. With DigitalOcean, you'll need to manage multiple droplets, configure load balancers, and handle scaling, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

## The Solution: Cloudways for SaaS

Cloudways is a managed cloud hosting platform that offers a more streamlined and cost-effective solution for SaaS businesses. With Cloudways, you can focus on growing your business while leaving the infrastructure management to the experts. Here are some key benefits of using Cloudways for your SaaS:

*   **Managed infrastructure**: Cloudways handles server management, security, and updates, freeing up your time for more important tasks.
*   **Scalability**: Cloudways allows you to scale your infrastructure up or down as needed, without the need for manual configuration.
*   **Cost-effective**: Cloudways offers a more cost-effective solution than DigitalOcean, especially for large SaaS businesses.

## The Numbers Behind This

Let's compare the costs of DigitalOcean and Cloudways for a SaaS with 500 users. We'll assume the following:

*   **DigitalOcean**: 5 droplets with 2 CPU cores each, 8GB RAM, and 30GB SSD storage. Total cost: $625/month.
*   **Cloudways**: 1 server with 4 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and 60GB SSD storage. Total cost: $449/month.

In addition to the server costs, we need to consider the developer time required to manage the infrastructure. With DigitalOcean, you'll need to spend around 10 hours per week managing droplets, configuring load balancers, and handling scaling. With Cloudways, you'll save around 5 hours per week, as the platform handles most of the infrastructure management.
